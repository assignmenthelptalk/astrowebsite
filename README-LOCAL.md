# Local Repo Note (Canonical Path)

Use this local folder as the **single source of truth** for edits:

`C:\Users\jobmu\ciiassignmenthelp\astrowebsite`

## Why
- Avoids confusion from multiple local clones.
- Keeps GitHub Desktop, Luigi edits, GitHub, and Vercel in sync.

## Rules
1. Make all edits in this folder only.
2. Push from this repo to `origin/main`.
3. Ignore old duplicate clone(s), especially:
   - `C:\Users\jobmu\.openclaw\workspace\astrowebsite-DO-NOT-USE`

## Remote (unchanged)
- `https://github.com/assignmenthelptalk/astrowebsite.git`
